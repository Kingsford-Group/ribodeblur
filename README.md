# Ribodelur: a python package for estimating A-site locations of ribosomes from ribo-seq

Ribodeblur is a suite of python scripts that perform noise reduction for ribosome profiling data. Ribosome profiling is a high-throughput-sequencing technique that captures mRNA fragments underneath ribosomes during translation. It is widely used to study translational dynamics and mechanics. Despite the fixed size of a ribosome, the size of captured mRNA fragments can span a wide range due to imperfect digestion during the complicated sequencing process. Such a side effect distort ribosome locations and thus can confound interpretations of the translational process. We developed a computational method to recover a clear ribiosome A-site position signal from ribosome profiling data. Our method successfully reduce noise from ribosome profiles and we hope our method can advance discoveries of translational regulations.
